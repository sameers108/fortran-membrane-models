# fortran-membrane-models
Numerical analysis of membrane tube formation from lipid bilayers using Fortran (4th-order ODE solvers) and MATLAB visualization. Simulates endocytosis dynamics by modeling curvature, tension, and protein interactions, with computational modifications to generate novel parameter predictions.
