Numerical analysis of membrane tube formation from lipid bilayers using Fortran (4th-order ODE solvers) and MATLAB visualization. Simulates endocytosis dynamics by modeling curvature, tension, and protein interactions, with computational modifications to generate novel parameter predictions.

Membrane Tube Dynamics
üìå Overview

This repository contains the numerical analysis of membrane tube formation from lipid bilayer membranes, with a focus on modeling endocytosis dynamics. The project was completed during an internship at the Bio-Microfluidic and Soft Matter Research Lab, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, IIT Delhi (Dec 2024).

The work involves solving 4th-order non-linear differential equations using Fortran, introducing computational modifications for novel parameter predictions, and utilizing MATLAB for post-processing, analysis, and visualization.
